<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>

## TechStack/framework used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

Our face mask detector doesn't use any morphed masked images dataset and the model is accurate. Owing to the use of MobileNetV2 architecture, it isÂ computationally efficient, thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code>

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo 
```
$ cd Face-Mask-Detection
```

3. Create a Python virtual environment named 'test' and activate it
```
$ virtualenv test
```
```
$ source test/bin/activate
```

4. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Results

#### Our model gave 98% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training via <code>tensorflow-gpu==2.5.0</code>
